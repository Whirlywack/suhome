## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target

**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities while maintaining brutalist aesthetic integrity.

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Focus indicators: 2px ring with primary color and 2px offset
- Text sizing: Support up to 200% zoom without horizontal scrolling

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: Full site navigable via keyboard with logical tab order
- Screen reader support: Semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA labels where needed
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px × 44px for all interactive elements

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for any images used
- Heading structure: Logical heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Form labels: Explicit labels for email contact functionality

### Testing Strategy

Manual testing with keyboard navigation, screen reader testing with NVDA/VoiceOver, automated accessibility scanning with axe-core, color contrast verification with automated tools.

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, large phones |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Desktop computers |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large desktop screens |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop. Services section stacks vertically on mobile with full-width cards.

**Navigation Changes:** Mobile navigation remains horizontal with smaller typography. Consider hamburger menu only if needed for very small screens.

**Content Priority:** Hero message remains prominent on all devices. Services section maintains equal weight on mobile through vertical stacking.

**Interaction Changes:** Hover states convert to active states on touch devices. Ensure email links work properly on mobile email clients.

## Motion & Interaction

### Animation Philosophy

Subtle, purposeful motion that enhances the beauty of the interface without distraction. Animations serve aesthetic and usability purposes, never marketing goals.

### Interaction Patterns

- **Link Hover:** Elegant underline transitions that feel sophisticated
- **Focus States:** Beautiful focus indicators that maintain design integrity
- **Page Transitions:** Smooth, architectural transitions between content areas
- **Typography Animations:** Subtle letter-spacing or line-height adjustments on hover

## Technical Excellence

### Performance as Design Feature

The website's performance itself demonstrates our technical capabilities and attention to detail.

### Design-First Performance Strategy

Typography-focused design minimizes resource dependencies. Beautiful layouts achieved through CSS architecture rather than heavy assets. Progressive enhancement ensures core beauty is accessible to all users.
