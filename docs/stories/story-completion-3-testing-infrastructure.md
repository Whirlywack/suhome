# Story: Playwright Testing Framework & CI Pipeline

**Epic:** Implementation Completion - Brownfield Enhancement
**Story ID:** completion-3
**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** TBD

## User Story

As a **development team**,
I want **automated Playwright testing with GitHub Actions CI and Lighthouse integration**,
So that **we can catch regressions early and maintain code quality automatically**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: GitHub repository, existing package.json scripts, Vercel deployment
- Technology: Node.js testing ecosystem, GitHub Actions, existing npm scripts
- Follows pattern: Existing script structure and CI/CD patterns (if any)
- Touch points: package.json, GitHub Actions workflows, test file structure

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. Playwright framework installed and configured with basic smoke tests
2. GitHub Actions workflow created with Playwright + Lighthouse integration
3. CI pipeline runs on pull requests and reports results

### Integration Requirements
4. Existing npm scripts and build process continue to work unchanged
5. New test scripts follow existing package.json script patterns
6. Integration with GitHub maintains current PR/merge workflow

### Quality Requirements
7. Tests cover basic homepage, navigation, and key user flows
8. Lighthouse performance checks integrated into CI
9. No regression in existing development workflow verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add Playwright as dev dependency, create .github/workflows for CI, add test scripts to package.json
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow existing npm script naming and GitHub repository structure
- **Key Constraints:** Must not interfere with existing development server or build process

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Playwright installed and configured
- [ ] Smoke tests created for homepage and navigation
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow running successfully
- [ ] Lighthouse integration functional in CI
- [ ] Tests pass locally and in CI
- [ ] Existing development workflow unchanged
- [ ] CI provides clear pass/fail feedback on PRs

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** CI pipeline conflicts with existing deployment or development workflow
**Mitigation:** Test CI configuration on feature branch first, ensure no interference with existing processes
**Rollback:** Remove GitHub Actions workflow and Playwright dependencies

## Files to Create/Modify

- `package.json` (add Playwright dependencies and test scripts)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (new CI pipeline)
- `tests/` directory (new test files)
- `playwright.config.ts` (Playwright configuration)
- Potentially update `.gitignore` for test artifacts
