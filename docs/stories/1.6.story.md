# Story 1.6: Pre-Implementation Cleanup & Design System Alignment

## Status
Ready for development

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the codebase cleaned and design system aligned with HTML mockup,
**so that** Story 2.1 implementation can proceed without conflicts or inconsistencies.

---

## Cleanup Objectives

### Remove Obsolete Components
- **Footer component:** Not needed for one-pager approach
- **Design system demo page:** Development utility no longer required
- **Placeholder content:** Clear existing homepage content for new implementation

### Align Design System
- **Color tokens:** Update HSL values to match HTML mockup exactly
- **Missing tokens:** Add `--subtle` and other mockup-specific tokens
- **Verify spacing:** Confirm Perfect Fifth system compatibility (already perfect)

### Prepare Component Foundation
- **Layout structure:** Ensure proper foundation for one-pager sections
- **Theme system preparation:** Set up for theme toggle integration
- **Navigation foundation:** Prepare header for dual behavior enhancement

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Footer component removed** from codebase and layout imports
2. **Design system demo page deleted** (`app/design-system/`)
3. **Color tokens updated** to match HTML mockup exactly:
   - `--background: 0 0% 97%` (was 98%)
   - `--foreground: 0 0% 8%` (was 10.2%)
   - `--muted: 0 0% 94%` (remove hue/saturation)
   - `--muted-foreground: 0 0% 40%` (remove hue/saturation)
   - `--border: 0 0% 88%` (update value)
   - `--accent: 0 0% 15%` (completely new value)
   - `--subtle: 0 0% 92%` (new token)
4. **Layout.tsx prepared** for Header integration and theme system
5. **Homepage placeholder cleared** and ready for 6-section implementation
6. **Perfect Fifth spacing verified** and documented as compatible
7. **No broken imports or references** after cleanup
8. **All existing functionality preserved** (error boundaries, fonts, etc.)

## Design System Verification Report

### ‚úÖ **ALREADY COMPATIBLE:**
- **Perfect Fifth spacing:** Exact match with HTML mockup (0.25rem ‚Üí 5rem)
- **Typography scale:** Compatible with mockup font size requirements
- **Container system:** Works with mockup max-width and responsive design
- **Component architecture:** Solid foundation for section-based layout

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES UPDATES:**
- **Color values:** 7 color tokens need adjustment to match mockup
- **Missing tokens:** Need to add `--subtle` token for background textures
- **Dark mode:** Update to complement new light mode colors

### üßπ **CLEANUP NEEDED:**
- **Footer:** Remove (not used in one-pager)
- **Design system page:** Remove (development utility)
- **Placeholder content:** Clear for new implementation

## Integration Notes

### Preparation for Story 2.1
- This cleanup ensures Story 2.1 can implement all 6 sections without conflicts
- Color system will match HTML mockup exactly
- Layout structure prepared for section-based architecture
- No obsolete components to cause confusion during implementation

### Preparation for Story 2.2
- Header component remains but ready for theme toggle enhancement
- Layout prepared for dual navigation integration
- Skip link structure ready for accessibility implementation

### Maintained Functionality
- Error boundaries preserved and working
- Font loading system intact
- Perfect Fifth spacing system confirmed compatible
- Component architecture remains solid

## Dev Notes

- **Color updates:** Use exact HSL values from HTML mockup for pixel-perfect match
- **Cleanup priority:** Remove components that conflict with one-pager approach
- **Foundation focus:** Prepare solid base for implementation, don't implement features
- **Compatibility verified:** Perfect Fifth spacing system is already perfect match
- **Theme preparation:** Layout ready for theme toggle integration in Story 2.2
