# Story 1.5: Hero Component Configuration System

## Status
Complete
## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the Hero component to accept configurable content via props,
**so that** content can be managed without code changes and components remain reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hero component accepts title, subtitle, and description as props
2. Content props have proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
3. Default fallback content ensures component renders if props are missing
4. Props support rich text formatting while maintaining security
5. Component maintains brutalist design system consistency regardless of content length
6. Configuration system is documented with usage examples for future development

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion [Source: 1.4.error-boundary-implementation.md]:
- Hero component successfully wrapped with error boundary in app/page.tsx
- Component uses 'use client' directive for Framer Motion animations
- Current implementation has hardcoded content that needs to be made configurable
- Error boundaries properly isolate component failures

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this client-side component configuration story.

### Component Specifications
Hero component requirements based on existing implementation and architecture [Source: components/sections/hero.tsx]:
- Must maintain 'use client' directive for Framer Motion support
- Uses Heading and Text components from typography system
- Implements z-pattern layout with two columns (content left, visual right)
- Animation configuration with motion.div for entrance effects
- **Props Interface Structure**:
  ```typescript
  interface HeroProps {
    title?: React.ReactNode;      // Main heading text
    subtitle?: React.ReactNode;   // Highlighted text within title
    description?: React.ReactNode; // Supporting text below title
    visualContent?: React.ReactNode; // Right column content
  }
  ```
- Component follows forwardRef pattern per standards [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]
- Maximum 200 lines per component file [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #21]

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Hero component: `components/sections/hero.tsx` (existing - to be modified)
- Page implementation: `app/page.tsx` (existing - to be updated)
- Typography components: `components/ui/typography.tsx` (dependency - no changes)

### Testing Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]:
- Manual browser testing only - no automated test framework
- Visual inspection across desktop and mobile viewports
- TypeScript compilation validation
- Browser DevTools for prop verification
- Test with Chrome, Safari, Firefox for cross-browser compatibility

### Technical Constraints
From architecture documentation:
- **React Version**: 18.3.1 with Next.js 14.2.25 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript**: Version 5.6.3 with strict mode [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Component Standards**: Follow forwardRef pattern, complete TypeScript interfaces [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]
- **Framer Motion**: Version 10.18.0 for animations [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Spacing System**: 8px base unit (0.5rem increments) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #1]
- **Typography Scale**: Use mega, hero, display, base sizes [Source: architecture/styling-guidelines.md]
- **Color Palette**: 5-color limit per design system [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #11]
- **Security**: No dangerouslySetInnerHTML, validate all inputs [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #22]
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #16]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
From architecture [Source: architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]:
- **Test file location**: No test files - manual testing only
- **Test standards**: Browser-based manual verification
- **Testing frameworks**: None - manual testing workflow
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test Hero renders with no props (fallback content)
  - Test with all props provided with various content lengths
  - Verify React.ReactNode props accept JSX elements
  - Check TypeScript compilation with strict mode
  - Validate brutalist design consistency
  - Test responsive layout on mobile and desktop
  - Ensure error boundary continues to catch errors
  - Verify Framer Motion animations work correctly
