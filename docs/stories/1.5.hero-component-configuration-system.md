# Story 1.5: Hero Component Configuration System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the Hero component to accept configurable content via props,
**so that** content can be managed without code changes and components remain reusable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Hero component accepts title, subtitle, and description as props
2. Content props have proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
3. Default fallback content ensures component renders if props are missing
4. Props support rich text formatting while maintaining security
5. Component maintains brutalist design system consistency regardless of content length
6. Configuration system is documented with usage examples for future development

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Refactor Hero component to accept content props (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create HeroProps interface with title, subtitle, description fields
  - [ ] Update Hero component signature to accept props
  - [ ] Pass props to appropriate Typography components
  - [ ] Maintain 'use client' directive for Framer Motion compatibility
- [ ] Implement TypeScript interfaces and type safety (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Define HeroProps interface with proper types
  - [ ] Add optional flags for all content fields
  - [ ] Export interface for reusability
  - [ ] Ensure type checking passes with strict mode
- [ ] Add default fallback content (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Set default values in component props destructuring
  - [ ] Provide meaningful fallback text that follows brand voice
  - [ ] Test component renders without any props
  - [ ] Verify fallback content maintains design system
- [ ] Support rich text formatting safely (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Allow React.ReactNode type for content fields
  - [ ] Enable JSX elements to be passed as props
  - [ ] Maintain XSS protection (no dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
  - [ ] Support inline styling through className props
- [ ] Ensure design system consistency (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Test with various content lengths
  - [ ] Verify spacing remains consistent with 8px base unit
  - [ ] Check typography hierarchy preservation
  - [ ] Validate responsive behavior across breakpoints
- [ ] Update page.tsx to use configured Hero (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Import updated Hero component
  - [ ] Pass configuration props from page level
  - [ ] Remove hardcoded content from Hero component
  - [ ] Verify error boundary continues to work
- [ ] Create documentation and usage examples (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to HeroProps interface
  - [ ] Create example usage patterns in comments
  - [ ] Document prop types and expected values
  - [ ] Include examples of rich text formatting
- [ ] Manual testing and validation (AC: all)
  - [ ] Test with missing props (fallback behavior)
  - [ ] Test with all props provided
  - [ ] Test with long content strings
  - [ ] Test with React elements as props
  - [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation
  - [ ] Check browser rendering on desktop and mobile

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion [Source: 1.4.error-boundary-implementation.md]:
- Hero component successfully wrapped with error boundary in app/page.tsx
- Component uses 'use client' directive for Framer Motion animations
- Current implementation has hardcoded content that needs to be made configurable
- Error boundaries properly isolate component failures

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this story.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this client-side component configuration story.

### Component Specifications
Hero component requirements based on existing implementation and architecture [Source: components/sections/hero.tsx]:
- Must maintain 'use client' directive for Framer Motion support
- Uses Heading and Text components from typography system
- Implements z-pattern layout with two columns (content left, visual right)
- Animation configuration with motion.div for entrance effects
- **Props Interface Structure**:
  ```typescript
  interface HeroProps {
    title?: React.ReactNode;      // Main heading text
    subtitle?: React.ReactNode;   // Highlighted text within title
    description?: React.ReactNode; // Supporting text below title
    visualContent?: React.ReactNode; // Right column content
  }
  ```
- Component follows forwardRef pattern per standards [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]
- Maximum 200 lines per component file [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #21]

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Hero component: `components/sections/hero.tsx` (existing - to be modified)
- Page implementation: `app/page.tsx` (existing - to be updated)
- Typography components: `components/ui/typography.tsx` (dependency - no changes)

### Testing Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]:
- Manual browser testing only - no automated test framework
- Visual inspection across desktop and mobile viewports
- TypeScript compilation validation
- Browser DevTools for prop verification
- Test with Chrome, Safari, Firefox for cross-browser compatibility

### Technical Constraints
From architecture documentation:
- **React Version**: 18.3.1 with Next.js 14.2.25 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript**: Version 5.6.3 with strict mode [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Component Standards**: Follow forwardRef pattern, complete TypeScript interfaces [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]
- **Framer Motion**: Version 10.18.0 for animations [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Spacing System**: 8px base unit (0.5rem increments) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #1]
- **Typography Scale**: Use mega, hero, display, base sizes [Source: architecture/styling-guidelines.md]
- **Color Palette**: 5-color limit per design system [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #11]
- **Security**: No dangerouslySetInnerHTML, validate all inputs [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #22]
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #16]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
From architecture [Source: architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]:
- **Test file location**: No test files - manual testing only
- **Test standards**: Browser-based manual verification
- **Testing frameworks**: None - manual testing workflow
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Test Hero renders with no props (fallback content)
  - Test with all props provided with various content lengths
  - Verify React.ReactNode props accept JSX elements
  - Check TypeScript compilation with strict mode
  - Validate brutalist design consistency
  - Test responsive layout on mobile and desktop
  - Ensure error boundary continues to catch errors
  - Verify Framer Motion animations work correctly
