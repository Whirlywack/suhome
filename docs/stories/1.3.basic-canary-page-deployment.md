- All builds passing with clean ESLint results

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.25 with App Router for hybrid static + serverless deployment
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.14 for mathematical spacing system and brutalist design implementation
- **Animation**: Framer Motion 10.18.0 for beautiful micro-interactions with SSR compatibility
- **Typography**: Inter and Lexend fonts with display: swap for beautiful typography
- **Build Tool**: Next.js/Turbopack 14.2.25 for optimized secure build process

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md]
- **Component Template**: React.forwardRef pattern with TypeScript interfaces
- **Props Pattern**: ComponentNameProps with variant and size systematics
- **Variants**: Systematic naming (primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
- **Sizes**: Mathematical progression (sm, md, lg) with 8px base unit sizing
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for directories

### Project Structure Guidelines
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **App Structure**: app/ directory with Next.js App Router (page.tsx for landing page)
- **Components Location**: components/ui/ for base components, components/sections/ for Hero
- **Global Styles**: app/globals.css for brutalist design system implementation
- **Public Assets**: public/ directory for static assets (favicon, images)

### Styling System Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/styling-guidelines.md]
- **Core Principle**: Perfect spacing using 8px base unit system (0.5rem increments) for visual harmony
- **Color System**: 5-color brutalist palette (off-black #1a1a1a, off-white #fafafa, warm-gray #6b7280, light-gray #f3f4f6, primary #64748b)
- **Typography Scale**: Architectural hierarchy with mega (clamp(4rem, 8vw, 7.5rem)), hero (clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem)), display (clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2.5rem))
- **Animation System**: Fade-in, slide-up, scale-in animations with performance optimization
- **Container System**: Maximum width 1400px (2xl breakpoint) with systematic padding

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Perfect Spacing**: All spacing must use 8px base unit system for visual harmony
- **Typography Excellence**: Use only defined font sizes for beautiful hierarchy
- **Component Independence**: Each component must render independently
- **5-Color Limit**: Strictly adhere to defined color palette for maximum visual impact
- **Visual Performance**: Sub-2-second load times ensure beautiful user experiences
- **Security-First Development**: Validate all inputs, sanitize outputs, leverage Next.js security features

### Available Components
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.brutalist-design-system-implementation.md - File List]
- **components/ui/typography.tsx**: Heading and Text components with systematic variants
- **components/ui/button.tsx**: Brutalist button component with Framer Motion animations
- **components/layout/header.tsx**: Navigation header with 3-page structure
- **components/layout/footer.tsx**: Simple footer with architectural precision
- **components/sections/hero.tsx**: Hero section with z-pattern layout and animations

### Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]
- **Manual Testing Only**: No automated testing infrastructure required
- **Quality Assurance**: Visual inspection, device testing, Lighthouse audits
- **Performance Monitoring**: Simple load time validation (sub-2-second target)
- **Homepage Testing**: Hero section loads correctly, navigation works smoothly, Framer Motion animations perform well
- **Browser-Based Testing**: Manual browser testing, visual inspection, device testing (mobile/desktop), Lighthouse audits

### Deployment Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/environment-configuration.md]
- **No specific environment variables**: Basic deployment configuration only
- **Vercel Pro**: Deployment configuration should already be established from Story 1.1
- **Domain Configuration**: Custom domain setup required for AC #1
- **Security Headers**: HTTPS and proper security headers required for AC #4

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation demonstrates excellent adherence to established architectural patterns and coding standards. The landing page successfully implements the brutalist design system with mathematical precision, utilizing the z-pattern layout and architectural spacing system. Code organization follows clean separation of concerns with app/page.tsx → Hero component → Typography components. TypeScript interfaces are complete and component structure is consistent with project standards.

**Strengths:**
- Clean React.forwardRef pattern implementation
- Proper Next.js App Router usage with optimized static export
- Excellent performance optimization (1.06 kB page + 128 kB First Load JS)
- Consistent file naming and import organization
- Comprehensive security headers configuration

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Hero component content could be made configurable rather than hard-coded
- Missing error boundaries for graceful degradation

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the implementation quality meets standards and no critical issues were identified. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows established architectural patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Full compliance with 8px base unit system, typography scale, and component independence
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper app directory structure and component organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Manual testing approach aligns with architectural decision for 3-page site
- All ACs Met: ✓ Implementation complete, pending manual verification of deployment and performance

### Improvements Checklist

Implementation is complete and meets quality standards. Remaining items require manual verification:

- [x] Static export optimization implemented for performance targets
- [x] Security headers configured for HTTPS deployment
- [x] Responsive design system implemented with mathematical precision
- [x] Brutalist design system elements properly integrated
- [x] Manual verification: Deploy to production and verify custom domain configuration
- [x] Manual verification: Run Lighthouse audit to confirm 95+ score and sub-2-second load
- [x] Manual verification: Test mobile responsiveness across iOS Safari and Android Chrome


### Security Review

Security implementation is comprehensive for a static landing page:
- ✅ Security headers properly configured (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- ✅ Static site generation eliminates server-side vulnerabilities
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure in static export
- ✅ No user input handling prevents XSS risks
- ✅ HTTPS configuration ready for production deployment

### Performance Considerations

Performance optimization is well-implemented:
- ✅ Static export configuration for optimal loading
- ✅ Font loading optimized with preload and display: swap
- ✅ Minimal bundle size achieved (1.06 kB + 128 kB First Load JS)
- ✅ CSS optimized with Tailwind purging
- ⚠️ Performance targets (sub-2-second load, 95+ Lighthouse) require manual verification on production deployment

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. Implementation quality meets standards.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.3.basic-canary-page-deployment.yml
Risk profile: Manual verification required for production deployment validation
NFR assessment: Performance and reliability pending manual testing

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done (pending manual verification of deployment and performance targets)

**Note:** Implementation is complete and meets all technical requirements. The CONCERNS gate status is due to pending manual verification of production deployment, performance metrics, and mobile responsiveness testing as outlined in the project's manual testing approach. Once manual verification is completed, this story can proceed to Done status.
