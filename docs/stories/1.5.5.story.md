# Story 1.5.5: Dependencies & Prerequisites

## Status
Completed
## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** all required dependencies installed and component skeletons created,
**so that** Stories 1.6 and 2.1 can proceed without import errors or missing dependencies.

---

## Prerequisites Overview

### Missing Dependencies
- **clsx** - Required for className merging in recommendations pattern
- **Component skeletons** - Prevent import errors during implementation

### Missing Files
- **PWA manifest** - Required by recommendations layout.tsx
- **PWA icons** - Expected by manifest configuration
- **Component placeholders** - Prevent build failures during incremental implementation

### Configuration Alignment
- **Utils pattern** - Ensure clsx + twMerge pattern works correctly
- **Basic security setup** - Prepare for next.config.js enhancements

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Required npm packages installed:**
   - `clsx` package installed for className merging
   - Package.json updated with new dependency
   - No package installation conflicts

2. **Component skeleton files created:**
   - `components/sections/about-story.tsx` - Empty component skeleton
   - `components/sections/contact-email.tsx` - Empty component skeleton
   - `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx` - Empty component skeleton
   - All skeletons have proper TypeScript interfaces to prevent build errors

3. **PWA asset files created:**
   - `public/manifest.webmanifest` - Basic PWA manifest structure
   - `public/icon-192.png` - 192x192 placeholder icon (can be simple favicon copy)
   - `public/icon-512.png` - 512x512 placeholder icon (can be simple favicon copy)

4. **Utils.ts verified for clsx pattern:**
   - Confirm `lib/utils.ts` cn() function works with new clsx dependency
   - Test className merging functionality
   - No conflicts with existing utility usage

5. **Build verification:**
   - `npm run build` completes without errors
   - `npm run dev` starts without dependency warnings
   - All existing functionality preserved (header, hero, error boundaries)

6. **Import path verification:**
   - All expected import paths work (even with empty components)
   - No TypeScript errors for missing components
   - Clean development experience ready for implementation

export default function AboutStory({ id, className }: AboutStoryProps) {
  return (
    <section id={id} className={className}>
      <div className="container">
        <h2>About Story Component</h2>
        <p>This component will be implemented in Story 2.1</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  )
}
```

interface ContactEmailProps {
  id?: string;

export default function ContactEmail({ id, className }: ContactEmailProps) {
  return (
    <section id={id} className={className}>
      <div className="container">
        <h2>Contact Email Component</h2>
        <p>This component will be implemented in Story 2.1</p>
      </div>
    </section>
  )
}
```

      disabled
    >
      Theme Toggle (Story 2.2)
    </button>

{
  "name": "Superoptimised",
  "short_name": "Superoptimised",
  "description": "An indie dev studio in London",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#0C0C0C",
  "theme_color": "#0C0C0C",

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality for a prerequisites story. All component skeletons are properly structured with TypeScript interfaces, PWA assets are correctly configured, and build verification was successful. The implementation follows the project's architectural patterns and coding standards.

### Refactoring Performed

Enhanced component quality to better align with coding standards:

- **File**: components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx
  - **Change**: Added TypeScript interface ThemeToggleProps and accessibility attribute
  - **Why**: Consistent with other components and improves accessibility compliance
  - **How**: Added proper props interface and aria-label for screen readers

- **File**: components/sections/about-story.tsx
  - **Change**: Added cn() utility import and enhanced styling with design system classes
  - **Why**: Demonstrates proper usage of clsx integration and follows design system patterns
  - **How**: Imported cn utility and applied consistent spacing/typography classes

- **File**: components/sections/contact-email.tsx
  - **Change**: Added cn() utility import and enhanced styling with design system classes
  - **Why**: Maintains consistency with AboutStory component and design system
  - **How**: Applied same pattern as AboutStory for uniformity

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ All components follow TypeScript interface patterns and import order
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed in correct directories as per source tree specification
- Testing Strategy: ✓ N/A for skeleton components - appropriate for preparation story
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

[Items handled during review]

- [x] Enhanced ThemeToggle with proper TypeScript interface (components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx)
- [x] Added cn() utility usage demonstration (components/sections/about-story.tsx)
- [x] Added consistent styling patterns (components/sections/contact-email.tsx)
- [x] Verified accessibility considerations for disabled button state

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Components are simple skeletons with proper TypeScript interfaces. PWA manifest follows standard format without sensitive data exposure.

### Performance Considerations

Minimal performance impact. Skeleton components are lightweight placeholders that will be enhanced in future stories. PWA manifest is appropriately sized for fast loading.

### Files Modified During Review

- `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx` - Enhanced with TypeScript interface and accessibility
- `components/sections/about-story.tsx` - Added cn() utility usage and design system classes
- `components/sections/contact-email.tsx` - Added consistent styling patterns

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.5.5-dependencies-prerequisites.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met with quality enhancements applied
