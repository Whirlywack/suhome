## Copy — Source of Truth (Homepage)

> This section is the canonical copy to be rendered on the Homepage. Keep text as written; do not add marketing CTAs.

### Hero (H1)
**Superoptimised**

### Intro (subheading)
An indie dev studio in London. Projects are chosen by fit — curiosity, design, and the chance to make something enjoyable, meaningful, or just plain fun.

### Studio Story
Superoptimised exists to follow ideas wherever they lead. Sometimes the result is small, almost throwaway; other times it grows into something bigger. The scale matters less than the spark.

The process is more of a rhythm than a method: sketch an idea, test it, shape it, discard or keep. Curiosity and play drive everything. What stays is what feels alive.

### Notes on AI
AI isn’t a feature to bolt on. It feels closer to the printing press or the microchip — a shift so deep it changes the way people live and create. A kind of quiet miracle.

Superoptimised approaches it with curiosity and care. The goal is not to automate everything, but to fold intelligence into the everyday in ways that feel natural, playful, and humane. When it works, life becomes lighter: less friction, more joy, new kinds of meaning.

### Principles
- Ideas should invite exploration, not exhaustion.  
- Design is attention: typography, space, motion.  
- Fun matters, even in serious work.  
- A good interface disappears; a great one lingers in memory.

## Layout & Grid (Homepage)

**Z-pattern, architectural print-journal vibe**  
- **Row 1 (Top line):** Left anchor = H1 “Superoptimised”. Right anchor = Intro (subheading).  
- **Row 2 (Diagonal flow):** Wide text block = “Studio Story”.  
- **Row 3 (Bottom line):** Two narrow columns or a 3-column grid for “Notes on AI” and “Principles” (set as typographic cards, no images, generous white space).  
- **Footer line:** Minimal, typographic only.

**Header placement (guidance)**  
- **Preferred (Desktop):** Centered brand + centered nav (Home · About · Contact) with generous tracking, to reinforce the print-journal symmetry.  
- **Alt (Desktop):** Corner layout — brand left, links right — if stronger edge tension is desired.  
- **Mobile:** Keep a single row, centered links (no hamburger necessary for 3 links). Maintain perfect spacing and accessible focus rings.

**Design system integration**  
- 8px base spacing (mathematical rhythm).  
- 5-color brutalist palette (off-black, off-white, warm gray, light gray, primary).  
- Typography scale: mega / hero / display; clamp() for responsiveness.  
- Max container width 1400px; spacious margins to achieve “architectural” feel.

## Acceptance Criteria (updated)

2. Homepage renders **exactly** the copy from **Copy — Source of Truth (Homepage)** (Hero, Intro, Studio Story, Notes on AI, Principles).  
3. Content remains authentic and non-sales; **no CTAs** or conversion elements.  
4. Visual design implements brutalist aesthetic with **perfect 8px spacing**, **architectural typography**, and **Z-pattern** layout.  
5. Header appears on all pages; navigation items limited to Home, About, Contact. Desktop = centered nav (preferred) or corner variant; Mobile = centered links.  
6. Fully responsive; sub-1s first contentful paint on a cold load under typical conditions.
