## Copy — Source of Truth (One-Page Sections)

> This section contains the canonical copy for all 6 sections to be rendered on the one-page website. Content matches HTML mockup exactly.

### Section 01: Hero

**Title:** Superoptimised
**Intro:** An indie dev studio in London. Projects are chosen by fit — curiosity, design, and the chance to make something enjoyable, meaningful, or just plain fun.

### Section 02: Studio Story

**Philosophy & Process**

Superoptimised exists to follow ideas wherever they lead. Sometimes the result is small, almost throwaway; other times it grows into something bigger. The scale matters less than the spark.

The process is more of a rhythm than a method: sketch an idea, test it, shape it, discard or keep. Curiosity and play drive everything. What stays is what feels alive.

### Section 03: Notes on AI

**Technology & Humanity**

_"AI isn't a feature to bolt on. It feels closer to the printing press or the microchip — a shift so deep it changes the way people live and create. A kind of quiet miracle."_

Superoptimised approaches it with curiosity and care. The goal is not to automate everything, but to fold intelligence into the everyday in ways that feel natural, playful, and humane. When it works, life becomes lighter: less friction, more joy, new kinds of meaning.

### Section 04: Principles

**Design Values**

1. Ideas should invite exploration, not exhaustion.
2. Design is attention: typography, space, motion.
3. Fun matters, even in serious work.
4. A good interface disappears; a great one lingers in memory.

### Section 05: About

**Team & Focus**

Superoptimised is small by design. A few people, enough to experiment, never enough to get lost in scale. Work happens where curiosity and fit align. Everything else is politely left behind.

**The Journey**
Curiosity starts the path. A fragment of an idea, a tool that feels missing, a playful thought worth chasing. Some journeys end quickly; others become long-running companions. Each sharpens the next.

**Focus**
Edges are where things get interesting — the overlap of UI, UX, and AI. Superoptimised builds what feels engaging to explore, not what's easiest to explain. Most of the time, there's no availability for outside work. But when a project feels like a match, it's worth the time.

**Design and Experience**
Contemporary products deserve more than function. They should be sleek, enjoyable, and meaningful. UI and UX aren't polish added at the end — they are the beginning. A product that feels good to use is already halfway to being loved.

**Who**
Based in London, reaching anywhere ideas travel. Always in motion, always busy, working on projects that feel alive.

### Section 06: Contact

**Get In Touch**

Superoptimised is usually at capacity, but an open channel remains. If a project feels aligned — thoughtful, curious, or simply fun — a short note is welcome.

No forms, no funnels. Just an email.

## Layout & Structure (One-Page Design)

**Section-Based Layout with Geometric Elements**

- **Section numbering:** 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06 (large, light typography)
