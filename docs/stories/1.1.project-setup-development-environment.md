### Styling System Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/styling-guidelines.md]
- **Spacing System**: 8px base unit system (0.5rem increments) for mathematical precision
- **Color Palette**: 5-color brutalist system (off-black, off-white, warm-gray, light-gray, primary)
- **Typography**: Inter for body text, Lexend for display text with architectural features
- **CSS Architecture**: Tailwind utilities preferred, custom CSS in globals.css only
- **Animation System**: Framer Motion with architectural animation utilities

### Development Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md]
- **App Router**: Use app directory structure for clean organization
- **Server Components**: Default to Server Components, use 'use client' only when necessary
- **Static Generation**: Leverage generateStaticParams for optimal rendering
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component with perfect sizing
- **Font Loading**: Use next/font with display: swap for beautiful typography
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for directories
- **Import Order**: External libraries → Internal utilities → Components → Types

### Simplified Architecture Approach
[Source: docs/architecture/simplified-architecture-no-complex-state-management.md]
- **No Complex State Management**: Simple useState only for 3-page structure
- **No Testing Infrastructure**: Manual testing approach for simplified scope
- **Simple Component State**: Basic React patterns for navigation and animations
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Focus on essential tools only

### Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]
Manual testing approach only:
- **No Automated Testing**: No Jest, Testing Library, or E2E frameworks required
- **Browser Testing**: Manual testing for 3 pages (home, about, contact)
- **Quality Assurance**: Visual inspection, device testing, Lighthouse audits
- **Performance Monitoring**: Simple performance monitoring for sub-2-second load times
