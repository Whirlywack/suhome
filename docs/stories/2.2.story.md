# Story 2.2: Navigation System

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** visitor,
**I want** clean, intuitive navigation between pages,
**so that** I can easily explore the company information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Navigation header displays on all pages with consistent styling
2. Clear links to Homepage, About, and Contact pages
3. Current page indicator shows user location
4. Mobile navigation is accessible and user-friendly with perfect spacing
5. Navigation implements brutalist design system with architectural precision
6. NO services or portfolio links anywhere in navigation

- [ ] Apply brutalist design system styling (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Update navigation styling to match 8px spacing system
  - [ ] Apply brutalist color palette to navigation elements
  - [ ] Ensure typography follows defined scale
  - [ ] Implement architectural focus states with brutalist-focus class
- [ ] Verify navigation links and restrictions (AC: 2, 6)
  - [ ] Confirm NAV_ITEMS contains only Home, About, Contact links
  - [ ] Ensure no services or portfolio links are present
  - [ ] Test all navigation links function correctly
  - [ ] Verify links match route structure (/, /about, /contact)
- [ ] Manual testing validation
  - [ ] Test navigation on all three pages (Home, About, Contact)
  - [ ] Verify current page indicator works correctly
  - [ ] Test mobile navigation on various device sizes
  - [ ] Confirm brutalist design aesthetic implementation
  - [ ] Validate accessibility compliance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1 (Homepage Content):
- App Router structure established with `app/page.tsx` and `app/layout.tsx`
- Brutalist design system implementation started
- Mathematical 8px spacing system established
- Component directory structure: `components/layout/` for layout components
- Manual testing approach confirmed for 3-page structure

### Data Models

No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### API Specifications

No specific guidance found in architecture docs

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/component-standards.md#component-template]
- **Component Structure**: Use React.forwardRef pattern with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Props Interface**: Follow ComponentNameProps naming pattern with children, className, variant, size props
- **Mathematical Spacing**: All components must use 8px base unit system (0.5rem increments)
- **State Management**: Simple useState patterns for mobile menu toggle

[Source: architecture/simplified-architecture-no-complex-state-management.md#simple-react-state-patterns]
- **Navigation State**: `const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false)` for mobile menu
- **Client Components**: Use 'use client' directive when useState is needed
- **Simple Patterns**: Avoid complex state management, use basic React hooks only

### File Locations

**Existing Structure**:
- **Header Component**: `components/layout/header.tsx` (already exists, needs enhancement)
- **Constants**: `lib/constants.ts` contains NAV_ITEMS configuration
- **Layout**: `app/layout.tsx` already includes Header component
- **Utils**: `lib/utils.ts` contains cn() utility for className merging

**Route Structure**:
- **Homepage**: `/` (app/page.tsx)
- **About Page**: `/about` (app/about/page.tsx - to be created in future stories)
- **Contact Page**: `/contact` (app/contact/page.tsx - to be created in future stories)

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md#quality-assurance-checklist]
- **Manual Testing Only**: No automated testing infrastructure for 3-page structure
- **Navigation Testing Checklist**:
  - Navigation works smoothly between pages
  - Current page indicator functions correctly
  - Mobile navigation is accessible and user-friendly
  - Responsive design works across device sizes
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.25 with App Router navigation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.14 with mathematical spacing system
- **TypeScript**: 5.6.3 for type safety and precision
- **Routing**: Next.js Link component for client-side navigation

[Source: architecture/frontend-developer-standards.md#critical-coding-rules]
- **Perfect Spacing**: 8px base unit system mandatory for navigation spacing
- **Component Size Limit**: Maximum 200 lines per component file
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components (Header.tsx)
- **Import Order**: External libraries → Internal utilities → Components → Types
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance essential for navigation elements

[Source: architecture/styling-guidelines.md#core-styling-principles]
- **Brutalist Focus**: Use .brutalist-focus class for focus states
- **Navigation Colors**: Apply 5-color brutalist palette (off-black, off-white, warm-gray, light-gray, primary)
- **Typography**: Use defined font scale for navigation text
- **Mathematical Spacing**: Apply systematic spacing grid patterns

### Current Implementation Status

**Existing Header Component Analysis**:
- ✅ Basic structure with Link components
- ✅ NAV_ITEMS integration for Home, About, Contact
- ✅ Brutalist design elements started
- ❌ Missing current page indicator functionality
- ❌ No mobile navigation implementation
- ❌ Needs enhanced brutalist design compliance

### Testing

**Test File Location**: No automated testing - manual browser testing only

**Test Standards**: Manual testing approach for 3-page structure

**Testing Framework**: Browser-based visual inspection and functional testing

**Specific Requirements**:
- Validate navigation appears consistently on all pages
- Test current page indicator shows correct active state
- Verify mobile menu functionality on small screens
- Check accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Confirm no services or portfolio links are present
- Test navigation performance and smooth transitions
