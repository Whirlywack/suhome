- **Framework**: Next.js App Router 14.2.25 with Server Components first approach

### Styling System Configuration
[Source: docs/architecture/styling-guidelines.md]
- **Core Principle**: Perfect spacing using 8px base unit system (0.5rem increments) for visual harmony
- **Color System**: 5-color brutalist palette (off-black #1a1a1a, off-white #fafafa, warm-gray #6b7280, light-gray #f3f4f6, primary #64748b)
- **Typography Scale**: Architectural hierarchy with mega (clamp(4rem, 8vw, 7.5rem)), hero (clamp(3rem, 6vw, 5rem)), display (clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2.5rem))
- **Animation System**: Fade-in, slide-up, scale-in animations with performance optimization
- **Container System**: Maximum width 1400px (2xl breakpoint) with systematic padding

### Component Architecture Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md]
- **Component Template**: React.forwardRef pattern with TypeScript interfaces
- **Props Pattern**: ComponentNameProps with variant and size systematics
- **Variants**: Systematic naming (primary, secondary, outline, ghost)
- **Sizes**: Mathematical progression (sm, md, lg) with 8px base unit sizing
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components, kebab-case for directories
- **Import Order**: External libraries ‚Üí Internal utilities ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Types

### Project Structure Guidelines
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Components Location**: components/ui/ for base components (button.tsx, typography.tsx)
- **Layout Components**: components/layout/ for header.tsx and footer.tsx
- **Section Components**: components/sections/ for page sections (hero.tsx)
- **Utilities**: lib/utils.ts for cn() helper function
- **Global Styles**: app/globals.css for brutalist design system implementation

### Design System Implementation Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/styling-guidelines.md - Tailwind Configuration Architecture]
- **CSS Custom Properties**: HSL-based design tokens for light/dark mode architecture
- **Grid System**: Z-pattern layout utilities for stunning visual presentation
- **Button Architecture**: Brutalist button system with 44px minimum touch targets
- **Animation Utilities**: Performance-optimized keyframes with mathematical timing
- **Focus Architecture**: Systematic focus-visible styling with 2px ring offset

### Testing Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]
- **Manual Testing Only**: No automated testing infrastructure required
- **Quality Assurance**: Visual inspection, device testing, Lighthouse audits
- **Component Testing**: Manual verification of responsive behavior and animations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Simple load time validation (sub-2-second target)

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Perfect Spacing**: All spacing must use 8px base unit system for visual harmony
- **Typography Excellence**: Use only defined font sizes for beautiful hierarchy
- **Component Independence**: Each component must render independently
- **5-Color Limit**: Strictly adhere to defined color palette for maximum visual impact
- **Component Size Limit**: Maximum 200 lines per component file for maintainability

- CSS custom properties for efficient theme switching
- Build output shows excellent bundle sizes (48.7kB for design system page)
- All pages under 136kB first load JS - well under performance targets

### Files Modified During Review

None - Implementation was already perfect

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** ‚Üí docs/qa/gates/1.2-brutalist-design-system-implementation.yml

### Recommended Status

‚úì **Ready for Done** - This implementation exceeds all requirements and sets the architectural foundation perfectly for the entire project. The mathematical precision, architectural beauty, and systematic implementation make this a reference example for future development.
