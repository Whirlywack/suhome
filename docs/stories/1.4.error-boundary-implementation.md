# Story 1.4: Error Boundary Implementation

## Status
ready for development 

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** error boundaries implemented throughout the component architecture,
**so that** component failures gracefully degrade instead of crashing the entire application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Root-level error boundary catches unhandled component errors
2. Section-level error boundaries isolate failures to specific page areas
3. Fallback UI displays user-friendly error messages with brutalist design consistency
4. Error boundaries log errors for debugging while maintaining user experience
5. Critical components (Hero, Navigation) have dedicated error boundary protection
6. Error recovery mechanisms allow users to retry failed operations

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create base ErrorBoundary component (AC: 1, 3, 4, 6)
  - [ ] Create `components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx` with React error boundary pattern and 'use client' directive
  - [ ] Implement componentDidCatch for error logging to console
  - [ ] Design fallback UI with brutalist design system styling
  - [ ] Add retry mechanism with resetErrorBoundary function
  - [ ] Include TypeScript interfaces for props and state
  - [ ] Add 'use client' directive at top of file for client-side error handling
- [ ] Implement root-level error boundary (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Wrap app/layout.tsx content with root ErrorBoundary component
  - [ ] Configure root boundary to catch all unhandled errors
  - [ ] Ensure root boundary preserves navigation and basic layout
  - [ ] Test with intentional errors to verify catch behavior
- [ ] Add section-level error boundaries (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Wrap Hero component in dedicated error boundary
  - [ ] Wrap Navigation component in dedicated error boundary
  - [ ] Add boundaries for ai-products, about-story, and contact-email sections
  - [ ] Configure each boundary with contextual fallback messages
- [ ] Implement error logging system (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create error logging utility in `lib/error-logger.ts`
  - [ ] Log errors with component name, error message, and stack trace
  - [ ] Include timestamp and page location in error logs
  - [ ] Ensure logging doesn't expose sensitive information in production
- [ ] Design fallback UI components (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create consistent error message typography using design system
  - [ ] Apply 8px base unit spacing for mathematical precision
  - [ ] Use brutalist color palette (off-black, off-white, warm-gray)
  - [ ] Include appropriate icons or visual indicators
  - [ ] Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add "Try Again" button to fallback UI using Button component
  - [ ] Implement state reset logic for error recovery
  - [ ] Test retry functionality with various error scenarios
  - [ ] Ensure retry maintains component props and context
- [ ] Manual testing and validation (AC: all)
  - [ ] Test error boundaries with intentional component errors
  - [ ] Verify fallback UI displays correctly across all boundaries
  - [ ] Check error logging outputs expected information
  - [ ] Test retry mechanisms restore normal functionality
  - [ ] Validate responsive design of error states

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 completion [Source: 1.3.basic-canary-page-deployment.md]:
- QA identified missing error boundaries as area for improvement
- Hero component successfully implemented and needs error boundary protection
- Static export configuration working, error boundaries must be SSR-compatible
- Security headers configured, error logging must not expose sensitive data
- Component structure established: app/page.tsx → Hero → Typography

### Data Models
No specific data models required for error boundary implementation.

### API Specifications
No API endpoints required for this client-side error handling story.

### Component Specifications
Error Boundary component pattern from React 18.3.1 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Must use class component for componentDidCatch lifecycle
- Implement static getDerivedStateFromError for state updates
- Use React.ErrorInfo type for error information
- Follow component template structure [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]
- **Class Component Implementation Details**:
  - `getDerivedStateFromError(error)`: Called during render phase to update state in response to error
  - `componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo)`: Called during commit phase for side effects (logging)
  - State interface: `{ hasError: boolean; error?: Error }`
  - Props interface: `{ children: React.ReactNode; fallback?: React.ComponentType<{error?: Error; retry: () => void}> }`
  - Must include 'use client' directive at top of file for client-side error handling

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Error boundary component: `components/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Error logging utility: `lib/error-logger.ts`
- Root layout integration: `app/layout.tsx`
- Section components to wrap:
  - `components/sections/hero.tsx`
  - `components/layout/header.tsx` (Navigation)
  - `components/sections/ai-products.tsx`
  - `components/sections/about-story.tsx`
  - `components/sections/contact-email.tsx`

### Testing Requirements
From architecture [Source: architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]:
- Manual browser testing only - no automated test framework
- Test error boundaries by intentionally throwing errors in development
- Use browser DevTools console for error log verification
- Visual inspection of fallback UI across devices
- Simple validation utilities can be added to `lib/utils.ts`

### Technical Constraints
From architecture documentation:
- **React Version**: 18.3.1 with Next.js 14.2.25 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **TypeScript**: Version 5.6.3 for type safety [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Component Standards**: Follow forwardRef pattern, TypeScript interfaces [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with brutalist design system [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Spacing**: 8px base unit system (0.5rem increments) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Colors**: 5-color limit (off-black, off-white, warm-gray, light-gray, primary) [Source: architecture/styling-guidelines.md]
- **Error Handling**: Clean error handling for beautiful user experiences [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #20]
- **Component Size**: Maximum 200 lines per component file [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #21]
- **Server Components**: Use 'use client' directive for error boundaries [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #7]
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components (ErrorBoundary.tsx) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md #16]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
From architecture [Source: architecture/manual-testing-approach-3-pages-only.md]:
- **Test file location**: No test files - manual testing only
- **Test standards**: Browser-based manual verification
- **Testing frameworks**: None - manual testing workflow
- **Specific requirements for this story**:
  - Intentionally throw errors in each wrapped component
  - Verify error boundaries catch and display fallback UI
  - Check console for error logging output
  - Test retry button restores component functionality
  - Validate fallback UI follows brutalist design system
  - Test on both desktop and mobile viewports
  - Ensure error boundaries don't affect normal operation
