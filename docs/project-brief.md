# Project Brief: Superoptimised Website

## Executive Summary

Superoptimised is developing a modern, brutalist-designed corporate website that showcases our London-based innovative development company's services and personality. The website will feature a clean, efficient design system with dramatic typography and a 5-color palette, targeting potential clients seeking high-quality, fast development services. Our key value proposition centers on being "speed demons with quality standards" - delivering elegant efficiency without over-engineering, deployed on Vercel Pro for optimal performance.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:** Superoptimised currently lacks a compelling web presence that effectively communicates our unique positioning as speed-focused developers who maintain quality standards. Our innovative approach and London-based expertise need a digital platform that reflects our professional capabilities while showcasing our personality.

**Impact:** Without a strong website, we're missing opportunities to attract quality clients who value both speed and excellence. The development market is saturated with companies that either prioritize speed over quality or quality over speed - we need to differentiate our balanced approach.

**Existing Solutions Fall Short:** Most development company websites are either over-engineered, generic corporate templates, or too informal. They fail to convey the combination of professionalism, personality, and technical excellence that defines Superoptimised.

**Urgency:** The quick development timeline requirement aligns with our company values of efficient delivery, making this project a perfect demonstration of our capabilities.

## Proposed Solution

**Core Concept:** A brutalist-designed website that embodies our "elegant efficiency" philosophy through bold typography, strategic use of our 5-color palette, and clean, modern layouts that load fast and communicate clearly.

**Key Differentiators:**

- Brutalist design aesthetic that stands out from typical corporate websites
- Minimal, purposeful content structure (Homepage, About, Contact)
- No unnecessary features or over-engineering
- Lightning-fast performance reflecting our speed-focused values

**Why This Will Succeed:** The website itself becomes a demonstration of our capabilities - showing potential clients that we can deliver beautiful, functional solutions quickly without compromising on quality or user experience.

**High-Level Vision:** A digital showcase that converts visitors into clients by clearly communicating our services, team values, and contact information through an impressive yet accessible design.

Consider adding a simple project inquiry system that maintains our streamlined approach while providing better lead qualification.

### Expansion Opportunities

- Development of sister sites for specific service verticals

- Developer community features for London-based developers

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms:** Web-first with mobile-responsive design
- **Browser/OS Support:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with graceful degradation for older versions
- **Performance Requirements:** Sub-2-second load times, 95+ Lighthouse scores, optimal Core Web Vitals

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend:** Modern JavaScript framework (React/Next.js preferred) or static site generator for optimal performance
- **Backend:** Minimal backend requirements; static hosting with form handling via Vercel or Netlify functions if needed
- **Database:** No database required for MVP; flat file or headless CMS for future content management
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Vercel Pro for deployment, automated CI/CD pipeline for efficient updates

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure:** Single repository with clean separation between components, styles, and content
- **Service Architecture:** JAMstack approach with pre-built static files and minimal dynamic elements
- **Integration Requirements:** Analytics integration (Google Analytics or similar), email service for contact functionality
- **Security/Compliance:** HTTPS enforcement, basic security headers, GDPR-compliant analytics configuration

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Minimal external costs; leveraging existing Vercel Pro subscription and internal development resources
- **Timeline:** 2-week development window from start to production deployment
- **Resources:** Internal development team with existing brutalist design system and 5-color palette
- **Technical:** Must demonstrate our speed and quality standards; no complex backend systems or over-engineering

### Key Assumptions

- Existing brutalist design system provides sufficient foundation for rapid development
- Vercel Pro hosting meets all performance and reliability requirements
- Email-only contact method will be sufficient for client communication needs
- London-focused targeting will generate adequate qualified traffic
- Internal team can deliver both design implementation and development within timeline
- No complex content management requirements for initial launch

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Design Implementation:** Risk that brutalist design system may not translate effectively to web medium without extensive customization
- **Performance vs. Design:** Potential conflict between dramatic typography/visual elements and sub-2-second load time requirements
- **Contact Method Limitation:** Email-only contact may reduce conversion rates compared to forms with lower friction
- **Content Development:** Risk of timeline extension if copywriting and content creation takes longer than anticipated

### Open Questions

- How will the 5-color palette be distributed across different page sections and states?
- What specific metrics will define "dramatic typography" while maintaining readability?
- Should we include any social proof elements (testimonials, client logos) in the MVP?
- How will we handle contact email management and response tracking?
- What level of SEO optimization is realistic within the 2-week timeline?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Competitive analysis of other London development agency websites for differentiation opportunities
- User testing of brutalist design elements for accessibility and usability
- Performance benchmarking of similar sites to validate load time targets
- Email marketing integration options for contact lead management
