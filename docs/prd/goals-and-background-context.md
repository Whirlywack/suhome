# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a simple, beautiful website that states what the company actually does
- Implement a brutalist design system with architectural precision and perfect spacing
- Present content clearly and authentically without marketing language
- Build a clean, legally compliant website for a company focused on its own AI products
- Achieve beautiful typography and visual design that makes visitors think "wow, this looks beautiful"

## Background Context

Superoptimised is a company building AI products with beautiful UI/UX as passion projects and innovation work. The website serves as a simple digital presence for legal compliance and authentic representation of what the company does.

This is not a service business seeking clients - leads come from elsewhere. The website should be clean, focused, and beautiful, presenting the company's actual mission without conversion goals or marketing speak. The focus is entirely on beautiful design implementation and proper content presentation.
