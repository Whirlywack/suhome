# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

Establish the foundational project infrastructure including development environment setup, brutalist design system implementation with architectural precision, deployment pipeline, and a basic canary page that demonstrates beautiful design execution while providing a deployable foundation for subsequent epics.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a developer,
I want a properly configured development environment with build tools and deployment pipeline,
so that I can efficiently develop and deploy the website with confidence.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Modern JavaScript framework (React/Next.js) project initialized with TypeScript support
2. Vercel Pro deployment configuration established with automatic deployments
3. Git repository configured with proper branch protection and CI/CD pipeline
4. Development server running locally with hot reload functionality
5. Build process optimized for static site generation and performance
6. ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality consistency

## Story 1.2: Brutalist Design System Implementation

As a developer,
I want the brutalist design system components and styling framework implemented with architectural precision,
so that I can build beautiful, consistent pages with perfect spacing and typography.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Color palette defined as CSS custom properties with mathematical precision
2. Beautiful typography system implemented with perfect spacing and dramatic impact
3. Component library structure established for navigation and content presentation
4. Responsive grid system implemented for mobile-first approach with architectural precision
5. Base styles and reset CSS applied for consistent cross-browser rendering
6. Design system documented with component examples showing beautiful execution

## Story 1.3: Basic Canary Page Deployment

As a stakeholder,
I want a basic canary page deployed to production,
so that I can verify the infrastructure works and see beautiful design implementation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Simple landing page deployed with custom domain
2. Page displays "Superoptimised - Coming Soon" with beautiful typography
3. Page implements brutalist design system elements with architectural precision
4. HTTPS enabled with proper security headers
5. Performance metrics meet target (sub-2-second load, 95+ Lighthouse)
6. Mobile responsiveness verified across devices with perfect spacing

## Story 1.4: Error Boundary Implementation

As a developer,
I want error boundaries implemented throughout the component architecture,
so that component failures gracefully degrade instead of crashing the entire application.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Root-level error boundary catches unhandled component errors
2. Section-level error boundaries isolate failures to specific page areas
3. Fallback UI displays user-friendly error messages with brutalist design consistency
4. Error boundaries log errors for debugging while maintaining user experience
5. Critical components (Hero, Navigation) have dedicated error boundary protection
6. Error recovery mechanisms allow users to retry failed operations

## Story 1.5: Hero Component Configuration System

As a developer,
I want the Hero component to accept configurable content via props,
so that content can be managed without code changes and components remain reusable.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Hero component accepts title, subtitle, and description as props
2. Content props have proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
3. Default fallback content ensures component renders if props are missing
4. Props support rich text formatting while maintaining security
5. Component maintains brutalist design system consistency regardless of content length
6. Configuration system is documented with usage examples for future development
