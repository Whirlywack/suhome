Here's how I'd approach this for a beautiful single-page navigation experience:

## **Smooth Scroll Implementation Suggestions**

### **1. Core Scroll Behavior**
- Use Framer Motion's `useScroll` hook with custom easing curves
- Implement momentum-based scrolling that feels natural and responsive
- Add subtle parallax effects to sections during scroll transitions
- Include scroll velocity detection for different animation speeds

### **2. Navigation State Management**
- Active section detection using Intersection Observer API
- Navigation links highlight based on current viewport section
- URL hash updates without page reload (`#about`, `#contact`)
- Browser back/forward support for section navigation

### **3. Visual Polish**
- Smooth scroll progress indicator in navigation
- Subtle scale/opacity animations on section entry
- Navigation link underline that smoothly moves between active states
- Gentle blur/fade effects on non-active sections during scroll

### **4. Micro-interactions**
- Navigation hover states with smooth transitions
- Email button with hover animation and click feedback
- Section numbers that animate in as they come into view
- Geometric divider lines that draw in during scroll

## **Developer Brief**

### **Technical Stack**
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS or CSS Modules (maintain existing design system)

### **Key Requirements**

**Navigation Behavior:**
```typescript
// Navigation should:
- Scroll to sections with custom easing (duration: 800-1200ms)
- Update active state based on scroll position
- Sync URL hash without page reload
- Support browser back/forward navigation
```

**Animation Details:**
```typescript
// Framer Motion implementations:
- useScroll for scroll progress tracking
- useInView for section detection
- Custom spring animations for smooth scrolling
- Stagger animations for section content
```

**Scroll Detection:**
```typescript
// Intersection Observer setup:
- Trigger when section is 30% in viewport
- Update navigation active state
- Handle edge cases (fast scrolling, page load with hash)
```

**Performance Considerations:**
```typescript
// Optimization requirements:
- Throttle scroll events
- Use transform3d for hardware acceleration
- Lazy load section content
- Minimal layout shifts during animation
```

### **User Experience Flow**
1. User clicks "About" → Smooth scroll to section 04 with spring animation
2. Navigation updates active state during scroll
3. URL updates to `#about` without reload
4. Section content animates in with stagger effect
5. Same pattern for "Contact" → section 05

### **Implementation Priority**
1. **Core scrolling** with Framer Motion
2. **Active state management** with Intersection Observer
3. **URL synchronization** with Next.js router
4. **Polish animations** and micro-interactions

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this approach or adjust the technical requirements?
